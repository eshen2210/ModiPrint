Our unique integration of extrusion and droplet printing allows you to embed gradients of small molecules into hydrogels of any geometry.

This is the complete guide to ModiPrint, an open-source bioprinter. Construction and operation of this 
bioprinter requires the user to: 
1. Acquire all hardware via vendors. 
2. Assemble the hardware using this guide. 
3. Install the open-source desktop and microcontroller software. 
This document covers the entire process of building a bioprinter, navigating its software, preparing bioinks, 
and optimizing prints.
